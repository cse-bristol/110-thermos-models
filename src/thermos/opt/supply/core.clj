  "Optimisation model for heat supply problems.
  
  A heat supply problem is about finding a least-cost way to build an
  energy center which can meet demand for heat following a profile.

  The ingredients of an an energy center are

  - Plant, which directly produces heat (e.g. heat pumps, boilers)
  - Storage, which shifts heat within day

  The constraining factors are
  - Grid connections, which limit electricity in-flow and out flow
  - Plant & store sizes

  The problem is phrased as a MIP, after work by Marko Aunedi.

  The main useful functions are `construct-mip` and `interpret-solution`, which see.

  - `construct-mip` produces a MIP suitable for evaluation by the `lp.core` functoins
  - `interpret-solution` extracts useful information from a solved MIP
