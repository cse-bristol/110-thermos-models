  "Problem is a network model problem, as defined by the specs adjacent.
  
  This function should compute a structure which looks like

  {[i j] => {:count-min 0 :peak-min 0 :mean-min 0 :diverse-peak-min 0
             :count-max 0 :peak-max 0 :mean-max 0 :diverse-peak-max 0}}

  i.e. it tells you for the arc from i->j, if the arc is to be used,
       what are the min/max values for N connections, peak heat, avg heat,
       and diverse peak.

  An important tweak is that the peak flow includes un-diversification
  of demands by count (so there is also diverse-peak-min/max).

  The method in this one is a bit complicated compared to the more
  stupid implementation above.

  The algorithm is:

  1. Some edges are bridges in the graph; a bridge is an edge whose removal partitions the graph
  2. All other edges are inside a patch that would be connected with no bridges.
     Within a patch like that, all edges will have about the same result.
     This is because we are not going to count up all the hamiltonian paths through the patch.
     So the flows within the patch are determined by what can enter/leave that patch through
     the bridges that terminate in it
  3. Consequently, we can solve two sets of problems:
     1. What are the flow bounds on each bridge in the graph
     2. If we label all vertices by the component they are in when all bridges are gone,
        what are the flow bounds on any single edge in each component.
        We don't need to solve all the other internal edges in that component.

  As a subtle tweak, before thinking about bridges we take out every edge that is a
  connector. This is because every connector should be considered as a bridge, even
  if more than one connector terminates in a building; these are not strictly bridges
  but they are unidirectional for heat.
